Project-X
=========

![Project Mockup](mockups/design.png "Original Design")

Some fun with probability and Java, for an academic project. Project-X is a demo of a brief video game I made (in collaboration on a larger project) in conformity to a set of regulations of a Math project requiring students to demonstrate applications of [Binomial Probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_probability) to game scenarios.

###Technology
Using `java.awt.Canvas` along with `java.awt.Graphics2D`, the project simply renders to a canvas element placed across the entire window.

####Platforms
This should run in any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on Windows, Mac OS X, and most Linux distributions with a version ≥ 7 (although it might work on versions 3 ≤ 6, but I haven't tested for those platforms). Generally, it is probably a good idea to run this in Java 7.

####TODO List
* Implement scheduled drawing system for Canvas \( **done** \)
* Implement main menu \( **done** \)
* Set game object instantiation system \( **done** \)

###Collaborators
* Princeton Ferro (me; mostly code, instructions)
* David Casazza (instructions, other stuff)
